      <Typography variant="h5" paragraph>Privacy Policy</Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1' paragraph>Effective Date: January 31, 2024</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        My Tennis Space is a community-powered tennis sharing app that allows individuals to participate in ladders and events, and to post content, such as matches and comments (the "Service"). At My Tennis Space, we respect your right to privacy and we understand that users of our app ("App") and visitors to our website located at <a href="https://www.mytennis.space">https://www.mytennis.space</a> ("Site") need to control their personal information. The privacy policy below describes the measures taken by us to protect your privacy in connection with your use of our Service.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle2' paragraph>What personally identifiable data do we collect, and when do we collect it?</Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Unregistered Users.</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        We do not collect any personally identifiable information from unregistered users who see content from the app on our website or on social media sites like Facebook. Unregistered users have access to content available through the Service, but not within the mobile app. However, users must register in order to use the full functionality of both the Service and the App. For example, unregistered users cannot upload content or participate in events.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Registration.</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        Users must register and create an account and an account profile in order to use the full functionality of the Service. This is done by using either their Facebook or Google logins, or creating a username and password. My Tennis Space does not actually come into possession of users' Facebook or Google logins- that data remains on the Facebook or Google servers. Users may also submit other personally identifiable information as part of their account profiles, such as their name, email address, profile picture and location.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Location:</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        Registered users are asked for their location when they start using the app and this is essential for the service to be of value to the user. By providing location, the service will pick up your current location and will store this information.  The app may display an approximate location (for example your neighborhood or city) in your profile, for any events you partake in, and in other places. We recommend that users do not share their exact location during private chats, but leave that to users to decide.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Cookies and Analytics.</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the services we provide. If you are a registered user, we may use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your personally identifiable information. [Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.] We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google. Google Analytics collects cookies and usage data to track and examine users' use of the Service, to prepare reports on that use and to share these results with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google's privacy policy is available at <a href="www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Computer Hardware and Software.</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        We may also collect certain information about your computer hardware and software. An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Service. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information. We may also gather information about your internet service provider, browser type, operating system, access times, information about your mobile devices (including the mobile phone number you use to connect with the Service), your temporary geo-location and information about which pages you visit on our Site or through our App.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>How do we use your personally identifiable information?</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        My Tennis Space makes all of the information in your profile except your password, email, and exact locations available to all users of the App and the Site, including without limitation, your name, profile picture and general location, as well as all photos and other information you upload to the Service. If you include personally identifiable information in your profile or in the photos and other information you upload to the Service, then that personally identifiable information is made available to anyone and everyone who uses the App or visits the Site. It is up to you to decide what information you want to make public.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        If you register, from time to time we may send you e-mail messages and mobile push notifications informing you of our products and services, such as new features and services, special offers, updated information, or activity on your offers or posts. Our e-mail messages and push notifications may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the message and newsletters, including whether the email or push notification was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine such information with other information we have about you and may use this information to improve your experience with our Service and/or provide customized e-mail and push notification communications to you.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Who do we share your personally identifiable information with?</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        As mentioned above, the Service makes all of the information in your profile except your username, password, exact location and email address available to all users of the App and the Site, including without limitation, your name, profile picture and general location, as well as all photos and other information you upload to the Service. Email addresses are stored in our database. We do not otherwise share your information with third parties.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        We may also disclose any information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        We may gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or locations you seek information about) from time to time. We may use such information and the information we collect regarding your use of the Service to help us prepare publications of interest to our users or to share with advertisers. However, we will not share such information with any other person or entity in a manner that identifies you as an individual, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share information we have collected with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>How long does the service retain the personally identifiable information that you have submitted?</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        We keep the information you submit to the Service indefinitely, and we have no current plans to purge any of that information. This includes all the information you submit when you register and complete a user profile and all information (including photos) that you upload to the Service.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>What are your options to control the use of your personally identifiable information?</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        We recognize the importance of providing you with choice and control. If, after registering and giving us the personal information described herein, you wish to delete your account, you may do so by sending a request to us at support&#64;mytennis.space. We will delete your account and all of the personal information you have submitted to us within 10 days of receipt of your request. Attention: Opt-out. However, My Tennis Space does not offer any option for you to delete content you submit, such as photos and matches, from the Service. Once uploaded, such content can generally never be deleted by users.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>How can I update my profile?</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        All the information contained in your profile is viewable and editable through the account you registered with the Service using (Facebook or Google).
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>What about kids' personally identifiable information?</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        Neither our App nor our Site is directed to children under the age of 13. We assume users of our App or visitors to our Site are adults or minors supervised by a parent or guardian. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If a parent believes that his or her child has provided us with personal information, he or she can contact us via e-mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle2'>What else should you know about your privacy?</Typography>
      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Security:</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. The Service is ultimately hosted by Amazon Web Services, and all of the user information is stored on their servers. The profile account information and other content that the Service collects from users is protected by the security services implemented by those hosting services. Users can read about the features of those security services by following this link: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">https://aws.amazon.com/security/</a>. My Tennis Space also uses HTTPS through an extended validation Secure Socket Layer to encrypt all communications between Amazon Web Services and the user. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer or mobile phone and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet or over the telephone system, and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. Use of the Internet and/or the telephone system to send personally identifiable information to the Service is at your own risk.
      </Typography>
