      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Acceptance of Terms</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        By accessing or using the My Tennis Space app, service, or any web pages made available by My Tennis Space (together, the "Service"), however accessed, you, the User agree to be bound by these terms of use ("Terms of Use"). Please read these Terms of Use and the My Tennis Space Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not accept all of the terms contained in these policies, do not register or use the Service.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='subtitle1'>Overview of Service</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        My Tennis Space ("MTS" or "we") offers a platform for registered Users ("you") to access shared digital content, including without limitation, images, graphics, audio and video clips, text and data (collectively "Content") in an online exchange. Users that create a My Tennis Space account, including registering with an existing external account (such as Facebook or Google) or registering with an email and password, have the capability to both access  information and submit Content. Users that do not create an account may still have access to all Content posted on My Tennis Space and are subject to these Terms of Use. Registered Users can edit their “profile” with text and a profile image, create or join “ladders”, and create “matches” between themselves and other profiles on the Service. Users who join “ladders” can be contacted to issue a match challenge within the app and on the web by other registered Users on the same ladder, and can enter into a private chat to determine whether to accept the challenge, and to determine a time and place to play a tennis match.

      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        My Tennis Space is growing communities around tennis, and maintains the right to remove any comments or communication that are not related to tennis or goes against the principles laid out in our community guidelines. My Tennis Space creates a private chat for scheduling matches and users to determine where and when to meetup to play. We recommend that home addresses are not exchanged in these private chats and we do not make home addresses visible in the app. The chat and the real-life exchange is the sole responsibility of the users engaging in the scheduling or commenting on matches and ladders.
